I am a software engineer working on advanced data retrieval system at **Xiaomi EV**. My current work and research is focusing on improving the data retrieval capabilities over massive-scale data with large multimodal models and large vision foundation models.

Before joining Xiaomi EV, I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). Before that, I graduated from [Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST)](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology.
