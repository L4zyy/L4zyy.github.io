        - title: Build video retrieval system with 500k captioned video data
          contents:
            - Optimized LLaVA-based LMM through SFT/LoRA, empowering Auto-Triage’s problem distribution.
            - Build a self-driving multi-modal dataset including 50k video data and 900k image data.
        - title: Enhance the image retrieval system with large detection and segmentation model
          contents:
            - Developed a large detection and segmentation model based on Grounding-DINO.
            - Compared the trained model with CLIP-based retrieval system, the accuracy of detecting special obstacles has increased by 50% on average, mined over 600k false and missed detection data.
            - Supports 100+ types of special obstacle detection (municipal vehicles, small animals). The entire process of mining new categories is completed within one week.
        - title: Developed a CLIP-based image retrieval system
          contents:
            - Maintained a vector database of 7.5 million frames and about 1 million kilometers of data with CLIP.
            - Improved the road condition and single target search results by combining the detection results.
